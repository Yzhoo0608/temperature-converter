# Iteration 3 - Live Conversion, Dark-mode-toggle, and Conversion History Report

## Description
Iteration 3 adds several new features to improve interactivity and usability. It includes live conversion that updates the result dynamically once the user types, without needing to press the convert button, unlike iterations 1 and 2. A dark mode toggle was added to reduce eye strain and allow users to switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences. Additional buttons “Swap” to switch from and to units and “Reset” to clear inputs and outputs were also integrated into this iteration. Lastly, it keeps the last five conversion histories for users as a quick reference, so the user can trace back if they want.
